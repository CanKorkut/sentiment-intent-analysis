# :🧠 Sentiment & Intent Analysis

This repository contains the implementation of a **Sentiment and Intent Analysis** system, designed to analyze conversations in real-time. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) and intent (such as inquiry, purchase intent, complaint, etc.) behind user messages.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project includes several services:

- **API for Sentiment & Intent Prediction**: A FastAPI-based server that accepts text input and returns sentiment and intent predictions.
- **Streamlit UI**: A web-based user interface to upload conversation data (in JSON format) and visualize sentiment and intent analysis.
- **Logging Service**: A FastAPI service to log the results of the sentiment and intent analysis into a MongoDB database.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies messages into three categories: positive, neutral, or negative.
- **Intent Classification**: Predicts the intent of the message (e.g., inquiry, greeting, purchase intent, etc.).
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Supports analyzing customer and sales representative conversations in real-time.
- **Visualization**: A user-friendly interface to upload and display analyzed results, including a summary table.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### ⚙️ Prerequisites

Setting the [GROQ]([https://www.google.com](https://groq.com/)) API Key
This application requires a valid GROQ_API_KEY to be set as an environment variable. Here's how you can set it:

```bash
set GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

```
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9+
- MongoDB
- Anaconda

### 🚀 Setup
0. Create Conda Env:
   
```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.10
conda activate myenv
```
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-intent-analysis.git
cd sentiment-intent-analysis
```
2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up MongoDB:

```bash
docker pull mongo
docker run --name mongo-container -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

5. Start the Sentiment & Intent API:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

5. Start the Logging Service:
```bash
uvicorn log_service:log_app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
```

6. Start the Streamlit UI:
```bash
cd ui
streamlit run app.py
```
This will start the web interface at http://localhost:8501.

Usage
1. Upload a JSON file containing a list of sentences for analysis.
2. The application will predict the sentiment and intent of each sentence in real-time.
3. Results will be displayed with color-coded sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) and the predicted intent.
